# nanoWordClock

This tool can be used together with [this arduino library](https://github.com/CamelCaseName/HUB75nano) to create a word clock on the panel.
Simply build your setup according to the library instructions, connect your arduinot to your pc and start the tool.

You will then be asked for the COM port the arduino uses, you may refer to [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTbv9dpSEoI).
As long as your pc is up, the clock will display the current time in 5 min intervals.
